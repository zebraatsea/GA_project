# Genetic Algoritm Program

This is a program I created with the help of online and class resources for my CS 461 - Artificial Intelligence course at CSU East Bay.

This program uses the rand function to generate a random initial population. Determines the fitness level of each member of the population, and then using this information selects parents and with a random crossover point, creates offspring. Once all offspring are created, there is a small random probability to mutate some/any of the new population. This loops for a desired number of generates before returning the member with the highest fitness level.
